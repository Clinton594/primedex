                          At its core, cryptocurrency is typically decentralized digital money designed to be used over

                          Crypto wallets store your private keys, keeping your crypto safe and accessible. They also
                          allow you to send, receive, and spend cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum.

                          An initial coin offering or initial currency offering is a type of funding using
                          cryptocurrencies. It is often a form of crowdfunding, although a private ICO which does not
                          seek public investment is also possible.

                          A Token is just another word for cryptocurrency, it often refers to any cryptocurrency besides
                          Bitcoin and Ethereum (even though they are also technically tokens). Because Bitcoin and
                          Ethereum are by far the biggest two cryptocurrencies, itâ€™s useful to have a word to describe
                          the universe of other coins.
